[srvrlss.dev](https://srvrlss.dev) is a place for me to experiment and collect my thoughts. Years ago, I decided that I was not interested writing and maintaining what we could consider as "missing" documentation. As such, posts and content on this blog are *as-is* and benefit those who are curious, question and build on the work of others.

> I am intentionally staying away from topics that do not age well and focus on principles, practices, and experiences.

My name is [Alexandre Brisebois](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandrebrisebois/), father of two and a tech enthusiast. Working at Microsoft, I empower others to accelerate time-to-value, innovate and shape the world of tomorrow!
